This repository is intended to support the translation of Valter Viisk's "Elekter ja Magnetism Ãœlesandeid", Kalda's friend's handout. Here you will find source-codes for the handout, so that you can edit quiclky (trust me, trying to turn a pdf into a tex file is quite hard).

As this translation was done quickly by a high-school student who has no knowledge at all about Estonian, there will probably be lots of typos, mistranlations and other errors. So, if you have any insights or corrections, I strongly encourage you to submit a pull-request (if you don't know how to use GitHub, it's okay, neither do I). Also, I tried as much as possible to maintain formatting, margins, spacing, and figure sizing; however, there still are some minor miadjustments and I apologize for them.

Disclaimer: this handout is probably one of the best and most complete one can find on the internet and it is indeed my favorite. Nevertheless, nothing is perfect and there are some details, pedagogical choices, and formatting issues that I disagree with, but being this only a translation, I made no change in the document body at all.

Throughout the process of tranlation, I included some footnotes in order to briefly mention some advanced topics not covered in this material. If they are wrong or inappropriate, I take full responsibility for them.

The original handout has a quite extensive problem set, some of which have answers. For those that don't have an answer, I have tried my best to include it, however, due to the short time I had to translate it, a lot of problems still don't have any answers. As time flies by, I will try to include more and more answers, little by little, so have patience.

This translation was made by me in service for the COIN project, a Brazilian iniciative for olympiad handout publishing. As of this moment, we only have a Portuguese website, but soon we will be launching an English version. Check it out at coinproject8.wordpress.com
