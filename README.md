This repository is intended to support the translation of Valter Viisk's "Elekter ja Magnetism Ãœlesandeid", Kalda's friend's handout. Here you will find source-codes for the handout, so that you can edit quiclky (trust me, trying to turn a pdf into a tex file is quite hard).
As this translation was done quickly by a high-school student who has no knowledge at all about Estonian, there will probably be lots of typos, mistranlations and other errors. So, if you have any insights or corrections, I strongly encourage you to submit a pull-request (if you don't know how to use GitHub, it's okay, neither do I).
Throughout the process of tranlation, I included some footnotes in order to briefly mention some advanced topics not covered in this material. If they are wrog or inappropriate, I take full responsibility for them.
The original handout has a quite extensive problemset, some of which have answers. For those that don't have an answer, I have tried my best to include it, however, due to the short time I had to translate it, a lot of problems still don't have any answers. As time flies by, I will try to include more and more answers, little by little, so have patience.
This translation was made by me in service for the COIN project, a Brazilian iniciative for olympiad handout publishing. As of this moment, we only have a Portuguese website, but soon we will be launching an English version. Check it out at coinproject8.wordpress.com
